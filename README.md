# Ripple - IE Tech Challenge

The server_info.php PHP script periodically calls rippled’s server_info command and records the sequence number of the latest validated ledger along with the current time and record this data in the file data.txt. Then, uses this data to construct a plot (time on the x-axis, sequence number on the y-axis) with the Chart.js Javascript charting library that visualizes how frequently the ledger sequence is incremented every 5 seconds.

# Ripple - IE Tech Challenge

The `server_info.php` PHP script periodically calls rippledâ€™s server_info command and records the sequence number of the latest validated ledger along with the current time and record this data in the file `data.txt`. Then, uses this data to construct a plot (time on the x-axis, sequence number on the y-axis) with the Chart.js Javascript charting library that visualizes how frequently the ledger sequence is incremented every 5 seconds.

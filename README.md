# Ripple - IE Tech Challenge

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

Write a script/program that periodically calls rippledâ€™s server_info command and records the sequence number of the latest validated ledger along with the current time. Record this data in a file. Then, use this data to construct a plot (time on the x-axis, sequence number on the y-axis) that visualizes how frequently the ledger sequence is incremented over time (i.e. how often new ledgers are validated). Choose a time span and polling interval that can effectively capture and depict this information

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them


```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

chmod -R 777 ./

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
